/** The paper abstract, with LaTeX markup resolved to plain text. */
export const ABSTRACT = `High-precision humanoid control is limited by target-domain dynamics mismatch, where the same control objective can induce different realized motions under changes in terrain, payload, or actuator response. Existing methods either pursue zero-shot transfer through domain randomization or in-context adaptation without target-domain specialization, or require heavy adaptation pipelines that leverage target-domain data, such as model calibration, residual learning, or policy retraining. We present FADA (Few-Shot Domain Adaptation via Dynamics Alignment), a three-stage Planner–Inverse Dynamics Model (Planner–IDM) framework for few-shot adaptation in humanoid control. FADA first trains an oracle policy with privileged information and then distills the oracle behavior into a deployable Planner–IDM student through DAgger. At deployment, FADA freezes the planner and finetunes only the IDM using approximately 2 minutes of target-domain rollouts with standard supervised learning. Rather than requiring optimal demonstrations or rewards, FADA uses the paired actions and observations observed during these rollouts as supervision, aligning the IDM's action generation with target-domain dynamics. Experiments show that FADA outperforms both in-context and end-to-end adaptation baselines, improving task performance under dynamics shifts and enabling real humanoid robots to execute diverse high-precision whole-body tasks.`
